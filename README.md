The Pomodoro Timer app boosts productivity using the Pomodoro technique. It organizes work into 25-minute focused sessions, followed by short breaks, with a longer break after four sessions. The appâ€™s simple interface makes it easy to track and manage time effectively, helping users stay focused and motivated during work or study periods.
